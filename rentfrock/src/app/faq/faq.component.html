                <p> Rent frock Repeat is a clothing rental subscription service that allows you to receive a box of curated clothing delivered to your door every month. Wear, return, and repeat the next month with a fresh rotation of pieces. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select your rental pieces or let a stylist pick for you.</li>
                    <li>Wear, swap out, return, and repeat each month (or just the months you want)</li>
                    <li>Love something you borrowed? Buy it at special member rates.</li>
                    <li>Pause or cancel your subscription at any time.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>                    
        <button class="collapsible">How does swapping out work?</button>
        
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Depending on the subscription plan you choose, you’ll be able to swap out one or more items during the month, whether it doesn’t fit, you didn’t love it, or you wore it and want something new.</li>
                </ul>                   
             </div>
        <button class="collapsible">Can I buy the items? </button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Yes! If you fall in love with any of your items you can buy your favourites at special member rates.  The great thing about the subscription service is that you’ll have the month to really get a sense of what items you'd like to keep in your closet or send back.  No more buyer’s remorse from impulse purchases. All purchases made with your member's only discount are final sale.</li>
                </ul>                    
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">Can I pause or cancel my subscription? </button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul >
                    <li>Yes! You have the flexibility to pause or cancel your subscription at any time.  Whether you are going on vacation or just don’t need the service that month, you have control over your subscription. </li>
                </ul>

        <button class="collapsible">How are the clothes cleaned?</button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>We are working with our dry-cleaning partners to help us achieve two goals.  To ensure that each item is cleaned thoroughly (arrives fresh and clean each time) and to ensure that our process is environmentally friendly.</li>
                    <li>Through a variety of techniques, we ensure that each item is steamed and pressed, inspected for quality, and packaged with care so that it’s ready for you to wear. We will never dry clean with toxic Perchloroethylene. Our solvents are non-hazardous, non-phosphate oil-based chemicals.</li>
                </ul>                    
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How do I know the items will fit?</button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>New members complete a detailed questionnaire that not only asks for your measurements and size, but how you like things to fit.  We ensure that our stylists and technology select the pieces that match your preference. Additionally, each time you send your box back, you’ll be able to give us feedback on each item.  We will keep learning about your preferences and our stylists will see the feedback on your profile (and sometimes gently encourage you to step outside of your comfort zone).  We’ll just keep getting it better and better for you with each delivery!</li>
                </ul>                    
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How do the stylists help?</button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Members fill out a detailed profile, which you can update at any time. This information will help your stylist understand the sizes, fit, colours, styles and occasions you are looking for.  Stylists are on-hand not only to review what’s going in your box every month but also there to answer any questions you might have.</li>
                </ul>                    
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">Can I alter the items?</button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>We do not allow alterations on any of our items. Of course, if it is an item you fall in love with, you have the option to purchase and alter it once it is yours.</li>
                </ul>                    
            </div>
        <button class="collapsible">How do I give you feedback about what I received?</button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>After you’ve received your pieces, you will receive a notification asking you to go online and give detailed feedback about the fit of each piece; letting us know precisely where something was too tight, too loose, too short, too long, or if it fit perfectly.  This process will be quick and easy.</li>
                </ul>                   
             </div>
        <button class="collapsible">Am I able to change my style profile?</button>
        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>If you fall in love with an item and want to keep it, you can either purchase it at our members-only discount or hold on to it for another month, it's up to you.  If you keep the pieces for another month, your credit card will be automatically billed for another month.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>We know that things change, so we made sure you are able to update your style profile at any time and even leave notes for the stylists. During our launch phase, your style profile will be locked until September 2019, allowing us to purchase inventory based on your initial profile.  Once the launch phase is over, you will be able to update your profile at any time.</li>

        <div class="content">
                <ul >
                    <li>Our goal is to carry sizes 0-24 as we always have.  Because our inventory purchases are based on member style profiles, these profiles will dictate the number of styles we carry in each size.  We will continue to work towards carrying a great selection of styles for all our members as we grow. </li>

                    <li>You can still use the service! Because you can start, pause or cancel your subscription at any time, you have total flexibility.  Simply start your subscription at least 2 weeks prior to your event so that you receive your selection in plenty of time. You can choose which dresses you want to arrive and then you’d have them for the month, which allows you to not only have enough time to put together shoes and accessories, but also gives you the opportunity to make a last minute choice if you can’t decide between your options. If you aren’t in need of our services going forward, simply put your membership on hold. All of this for approximately the same price you would have paid for a 4-day rental for one dress. Not sure which dresses to pick? Stylists will be on hand to help you and will be able to access your style profile to make a truly personalized pick! Your feedback on the dresses is added to our data and we continue to learn and improve as we work with you.</li>
